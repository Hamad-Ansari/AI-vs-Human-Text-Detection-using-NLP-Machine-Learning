## 🎯 Project Overview

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to differentiate AI-generated content from human writing is crucial for academic integrity, content moderation, and cybersecurity. This project provides a complete, end-to-end solution for this classification task.

We go beyond simple text classification by performing a deep **stylometric analysis**—the study of linguistic style—to build robust features that capture the nuances of an author's (or an AI's) writing fingerprint.

## ✨ Key Features

-   🧠 **Advanced Stylometric Analysis**: Extracts over 25 features including vocabulary richness, sentence complexity, punctuation patterns, and readability scores.
-   📊 **In-Depth EDA**: Interactive visualizations using Plotly to compare text distributions, n-gram frequencies, and word clouds between AI and human authors.
-   🛠️ **Robust Feature Engineering**: Implements a full NLP preprocessing pipeline with tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
-   🤖 **Multi-Model Comparison**: Trains and evaluates a suite of models:
    -   Logistic Regression
    -   Naive Bayes
    -   Random Forest
    -   XGBoost & LightGBM
-   🧠 **Deep Learning Implementation**: A Bidirectional LSTM model built with TensorFlow/Keras for capturing sequential context.
-   🚀 **Production-Ready**: Includes saved models (`.pkl`, `.h5`), a vectorizer, and a prediction function ready for deployment in a real-world application.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

-   **Core Libraries**: Python 3.9+, Pandas, NumPy
-   **NLP**: NLTK, TextBlob, Scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer)
-   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
-   **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow 2.x, Keras
-   **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud
-   **Deployment**: Joblib, Pickle

## 📈 Results & Performance

The models were evaluated on a held-out test set. The LightGBM model, trained on TF-IDF features, emerged as the top performer among classical ML models, closely followed by the LSTM.

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
| ------------------- | :------: | :-------: | :----: | :------: | :-----: |
| **LightGBM**        | **0.961**| **0.958** | **0.965**| **0.962**| **0.991**|
| **XGBoost**         | 0.958    | 0.955     | 0.962  | 0.958    | 0.989   |
| **LSTM**            | 0.955    | 0.960     | 0.950  | 0.955    | 0.987   |
| **Random Forest**   | 0.945    | 0.940     | 0.951  | 0.946    | 0.985   |
| **Logistic Reg.**   | 0.930    | 0.925     | 0.935  | 0.930    | 0.978   |
| **Naive Bayes**     | 0.915    | 0.905     | 0.928  | 0.916    | 0.970   |

### Key Insights
-   **AI-Generated Text**: Tends to have more uniform sentence lengths, higher usage of formal transition words (`however`, `moreover`), and lower vocabulary richness compared to human text of similar length.
-   **Human-Written Text**: Exhibits greater variance in structure, higher sentiment polarity, and more unique n-gram patterns.

## 🔮 Making Predictions

You can easily use the saved models to classify new text. Here’s how to use the best-performing ML model:

```python
import joblib

# Load the saved model and vectorizer
model = joblib.load('models/best_ml_model.pkl')
vectorizer = joblib.load('models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')

# Input text
new_text = "Furthermore, the analysis of the data indicates a significant trend towards automation."

# Preprocess and vectorize the text (assuming a preprocessor function/class)
# Note: The full preprocessing steps are in the notebook.
processed_text = preprocess(new_text) # A placeholder for your cleaning function
vectorized_text = vectorizer.transform([processed_text])

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(vectorized_text)
probability = model.predict_proba(vectorized_text)

print(f"Prediction: {'AI Generated' if prediction == 1 else 'Human Written'}")
print(f"Confidence (AI): {probability:.2%}")
```
## test Human Written
Here’s why. I’m fully aware that most of what I read online these days is at the very least AI-assisted, if not entirely written by AI. Generally, I don’t mind. My main concern is whether what I’m reading is accurate or not. If I want to know how to operate my toaster, I don’t need to be assured that a human wrote the instructions. But when it comes to art and journalism, come on! With poetry, prose, etc., the whole point is the masterful placing of words in sentences, in paragraphs for the enjoyment and stirring of the reader.
